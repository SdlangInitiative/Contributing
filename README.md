# Contributing

Contributing to this org has a very low barrier of entry.

Basically:

* Create a repo with a working implementation in the language of your choice
* Open an issue in this repo linking to your repo
* And if all goes well I'll then fork it into the group's repos.

The main advantage of this is: Low barrier of entry and the original author gets to keep full control over the repo, since I'll only fork it instead of insisting that it be moved over into the group, and if the original author goes AWOL we'll still have a fork to work off of.
